# Using TonicNet artificial chorales to generate new works

This repo contains a collection of codes to do two things:
1.  Generate a large collection of synthetic Bach chorales, and evaluate them across a set of metrics
2.  Generate complete pieces from some cherry-picked chorales with a variety of orchestrations

Examples of the results can be heard here: http://ripnread.com/sample-page/blog/

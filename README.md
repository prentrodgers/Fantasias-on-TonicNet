# Using TonicNet artificial chorales to generate new compositions

This repo contains a collection of codes to do two things:
1.  Generate a large collection of synthetic Bach chorales, and evaluate them across a set of metrics. See the notebook TonicNet_Synthetic_Chorale_refactored.ipynb
  
2.  Generate complete pieces from some cherry-picked chorales with a variety of orchestrations. See the notebook TonicNet_Csound_Arpeggios.ipynb
  
Examples of the results can be heard here: http://ripnread.com/sample-page/blog/

To realize the pieces, you will need to install csound, and obtain the instrument samples from another of my repos: Diamond_Music.
